## Gaussian YOLOv3 in PyTorch

Implemented [Gaussian YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04620) (an uncertainty-aware and realtime object detector presented at ICCV2019) in PyTorch and reproduced the performance of the original Darknet implementation.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/motokimura/PyTorch_Gaussian_YOLOv3) for details.
