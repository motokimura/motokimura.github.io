## Monocular 3D Human Recognition

Implemented ["A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation" [Martinez+, ICCV'17]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03098) in PyTorch and reproduced the performance of the original Tensorflow implementation. See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/motokimura/3d-pose-baseline-pytorch).

By integrating this with a monocular object-specific distance estimation method, I've constructed a **monocular** 3D human recoginition system.

## Gaussian YOLOv3 in PyTorch

Implemented ["Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector Using Localization Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving" [Choi+, ICCV'19]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04620) in PyTorch and reproduced the performance of the original Darknet implementation.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/motokimura/PyTorch_Gaussian_YOLOv3) for details.

## Car Counting in Aerail Images

Developed a convolutional neural network to count cars in aerial images.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/motokimura/cowc_car_counting) or [blog post (in Japanese)](https://qiita.com/motokimura/items/d155d532a5f1dd02089c) for details.
